# Grand Health — Engineering Notes

Living orientation doc for the production app. **Read this first** when picking up the project in a new conversation. The codebase itself is the source of truth; this file is the map.

## ✅ LIVE: Staging on HTTPS at https://staging.mygrandhealth.com (updated 2026-06-16)

**Status: fully live and validated end-to-end.** Logged in successfully over HTTPS as a clinician test user — DNS → ALB → ACM/HTTPS → Fargate → Cognito → RDS all confirmed working.

- **App URL:** `https://staging.mygrandhealth.com` (HTTP redirects to HTTPS)
- **RDS endpoint:** `grandhealthstack-postgres9dc8bb04-1ez67niaci4f.ce1muwi8yqjt.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com`
- **DNS:** `mygrandhealth.com` is on **Squarespace**. The `staging` subdomain is delegated to Route 53 via four `NS` records (Host `staging`) pointing at: ns-1533.awsdns-63.org, ns-1833.awsdns-37.co.uk, ns-247.awsdns-30.com, ns-606.awsdns-11.net. ACM cert auto-validates through that delegated zone.
- **CI/CD live:** push to `main` → GitHub Actions builds image → ECR → rolls the ECS service (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`). GitHub repo has secret `AWS_DEPLOY_ROLE_ARN` + var `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://staging.mygrandhealth.com`.
- **Secret `grand-health/staging/app-env`:** real `DATABASE_URL`/`SERVICE_ROLE_DATABASE_URL` (RDS endpoint, sslmode=require), `USDA_API_KEY=DEMO_KEY`, Cloudinary name+key+**secret (set)**. **Still `REPLACE_ME`: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`** (diet AI plan generator) — fill via `put-secret-value` (read-modify-write with jq) then `aws ecs update-service --cluster grand-health-staging --service grand-health-staging-web --force-new-deployment`.
- **Test users (password `Grand1230!`):** clinician `nurse@grandhealth.local` (Dana Lopez), patient `patient1@grandhealth.local` (Sam Okafor). Created via `scripts/create-test-user.sh` + profile insert over the bastion tunnel.
- **Bastion tunnel** (for psql/migrations against private RDS): `aws ssm start-session --target i-0545839633bb8fc95 --document-name AWS-StartPortForwardingSessionToRemoteHost --parameters '{"host":["<RDS endpoint above>"],"portNumber":["5432"],"localPortNumber":["5432"]}'` then `export DIRECT_DATABASE_URL="postgresql://grandhealth:<pw>@localhost:5432/grandhealth?sslmode=require"`. **It keeps dropping** because the repo lives in an **iCloud** folder — see "move to ~/dev" below.
- **Redeploy with domain (idempotent):** `cd infra && npx cdk deploy -c stage=staging -c withService=true -c domain=staging.mygrandhealth.com -c hostedZone=staging.mygrandhealth.com`.

## 📋 Session log 2026-06-16 — feature work after go-live

**Shipped & deployed (migrations run on staging):**
- **Training 404 fix** — patient training-day deep link now shows a friendly "no program yet" empty state instead of 404 (`home/training/[day]/page.tsx`).
- **HR zones gap** — migration 0004 seeds zones only for clinics existing at migrate-time; staging clinic was created after, so zones were empty. Backfilled via new `supabase/snippets/seed_hr_zones.sql` (run on staging). Clinician Zones & targets editor now populated.
- **VO₂ max minutes** — session editor now shows **work-only minutes** (rounds×work) separate from **total session time** (warm-up + rounds×(work+recovery) + cool-down); auto-calc + save now use sensible defaults so values never persist as null/zero. Weekly summary "VO₂ max work" fixed. (Optional stored-data backfill SQL for old null vo2 sessions was offered — `UPDATE session_library ... WHERE kind='vo2max'`; unclear if run.)
- **Multiple sessions per day** — **migration 0018** (`program_days` got `id` PK + `sort_order`, dropped one-per-day PK, cleared null placeholder rows) — RUN on staging. Clinician program editor: each day has "+ Add session…", reorder ↑/↓, remove ×. Patient week view lists multiple per day; day detail shows a chooser (`?s=<id>`) when >1. Reads return `sessions[]` (`lib/training.ts`, `today-score.ts`).
- **Diet AI guardrails** — `home/diet/ai-plan-actions.ts` now sends a `system` prompt (stay on meal planning, no medical/diagnosis advice, ignore note-based prompt injection, no disordered-eating) + caps patient free-text note at 500 chars. Model stays Haiku. (One-shot diet plan generator is the ONLY Anthropic usage — not an open chatbot.)
- **Cloudinary secret** set in Secrets Manager (image/video uploads).

**✅ SHIPPED 2026-06-22 — workout logging:**
Per-set actual logging (clinician prescribes reps/weight; patient logs what they actually did; clinician sees it). Commit `04ae58a` pushed to `main` (CI/CD deployed) **and migration 0019 applied + verified on staging** (`exercise_set_logs` table + both RLS policies confirmed via `\d`). Tunnel/psql tip that worked: pull the URL from Secrets Manager and rewrite host to localhost — `export DIRECT_DATABASE_URL="$(aws secretsmanager get-secret-value --secret-id grand-health/staging/app-env --query SecretString --output text | python3 -c 'import sys,json,re; print(re.sub(r"@[^/]+/","@localhost:5432/",json.load(sys.stdin)["DATABASE_URL"]))')"`.
Remaining: browser smoke test — clinician program → strength session with exercises+sets → assign to patient1 → patient1 opens that day, edits reps/weight per set (autosaves) + Done check → clinician patient page → "View logged workouts →" link shows actual vs prescribed.
   - Files: `migrations/0019_*`, `schema.ts` (`exerciseSetLogs`), `lib/training.ts` (`getSetLogsForSession`), `home/training/[day]/{set-logger.tsx,log-actions.ts}` + page wiring, `clinician/patient/[id]/workouts/page.tsx` + link in `program-assignments.tsx`.

**Other open items:** fill `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to enable the diet AI generator; consider wiring the weekly VO₂ target to tally work-only minutes; run `add_missing_pillars.sql` / `seed_interactions.sql` snippets over the tunnel if those per-clinic tables are empty on staging; run `docs/staging-smoke-test.md`.

**🛠 Recommended: move the repo out of iCloud** (`~/Desktop/AI Projects/.../grand-health-app` → e.g. `~/dev/grand-health-app`). iCloud sync caused repeated `.git/index.lock` / `HEAD.lock` errors and the SSM tunnel/psql friction all session. Moving it fixes both.

## 📋 Session log 2026-06-22 — Oura: calories-burned card + bedtime/wake (built, NOT yet shipped)

- **Migration 0021** (`0021_wearable_bedtime.sql`): `wearable_daily_metrics.bedtime_start` + `bedtime_end` (text, ISO with device UTC offset).
- **Oura sleep fetch**: `SleepRowSchema` + DailyMetric + sync upsert + `schema.ts` now carry `bedtime_start/end` (from the primary long_sleep row). Whoop leaves them null.
- **Sleep page** (`/home/sleep`): "Last night" hero shows **To bed / Woke up** times via new `formatClockTime()` in `queries.ts` (reads HH:MM off the ISO string so it shows the device's local clock, no tz math).
- **Calories burned today card** on the **Today home page** (under the What-to-do grid), only when a device measured `active_kcal`. New `getActiveKcalToday()` in `queries.ts`. Card links to /home/diet and notes it feeds the daily goal (which it does in dynamic-mode plans via the 0020 work).

**⚠️ Migrations 0020 AND 0021 must both be run on staging** (the secret-overwrite outage interrupted things — 0020 may still be unrun). Run in order via the bastion tunnel + `DIRECT_DATABASE_URL`:
```bash
psql "$DIRECT_DATABASE_URL" -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -f supabase/migrations/0020_activity_aware_calories.sql
psql "$DIRECT_DATABASE_URL" -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -f supabase/migrations/0021_wearable_bedtime.sql
```
Without them, the Oura backfill/sync upsert (which writes active_kcal/total_kcal/bedtime_*) will fail.

---

## ⚠️ GOTCHA: never edit `secretObjectValue` in infra/lib/app-runtime.ts on a live env

2026-06-22 staging outage: adding keys to the `secretObjectValue` map (to wire Oura) changed that CFN property, so the next `cdk deploy` **overwrote the entire `grand-health/staging/app-env` secret back to REPLACE_ME defaults** — wiping DATABASE_URL etc. Symptom: every page 500s with `TypeError: Invalid URL, input: 'REPLACE_ME'` (postgres-js can't parse "REPLACE_ME"). Fix used: restore the prior secret version + roll the service:
```bash
PREV=$(aws secretsmanager get-secret-value --secret-id grand-health/staging/app-env --version-stage AWSPREVIOUS --query SecretString --output text)
aws secretsmanager put-secret-value --secret-id grand-health/staging/app-env --secret-string "$PREV"
aws ecs update-service --cluster grand-health-staging --service grand-health-staging-web --force-new-deployment
```
To add a new container env var: add ONLY to the `secrets` map (`ecs.Secret.fromSecretsManager(...)`) and set the value via `put-secret-value`. Do NOT touch `secretObjectValue`.

---

## 📋 Session log 2026-06-22 — Oura ring: wiring secrets to go live

Oura code was already complete (client, OAuth start/callback, webhook, registry, integrations tile). Gap: the three `OURA_*` env vars were never injected into the running container — the ECS task def in `infra/lib/app-runtime.ts` enumerates each secret key explicitly. **Added `OURA_CLIENT_ID` / `OURA_CLIENT_SECRET` / `OURA_WEBHOOK_SECRET`** to both the `secretObjectValue` defaults and the `secrets` (ecs.Secret.fromSecretsManager) map. CI/CD (`deploy.yml`) just describes the existing task def + swaps the image, so the CDK-defined secrets carry forward — only a `cdk deploy` adds them.

Facts for setup: OAuth scopes requested = `email personal daily heartrate` (the `daily` scope covers daily_activity → active_calories for the dynamic-calorie feature). Redirect URI = `https://staging.mygrandhealth.com/api/wearables/oura/callback`. Webhook receiver = `https://staging.mygrandhealth.com/api/wearables/oura/webhook` (optional; connect-time 14-day backfill + daily sync cron already pull data without it). Connect flow is patient-only, started by `/api/wearables/oura/start`.

**⏳ TO GO LIVE (Oura):**
1. Register an app at https://cloud.ouraring.com/oauth/applications → redirect URI above → copy Client ID + Secret.
2. Put all three keys into `grand-health/staging/app-env` (read-modify-write with jq; `OURA_WEBHOOK_SECRET` can be `openssl rand -hex 16`). **Set values before deploying** or the new task crash-loops resolving the missing JSON key.
3. `git push` then `cd infra && npx cdk deploy -c stage=staging -c withService=true -c domain=staging.mygrandhealth.com -c hostedZone=staging.mygrandhealth.com` (adds the secrets to the task def + rolls the service).
4. Test: patient → Me → integrations → Connect Oura Ring → authorize → bounces back "Connected… pulling last 14 days"; wearable Today card + clinician 30-day trend populate; `active_kcal` rows feed the dynamic calorie goal.

## 📋 Session log 2026-06-22 — activity-aware calorie targets (built, NOT yet shipped)

Make the patient's daily kcal goal respond to exercise. Each diet plan has an `activity_mode`:
- **static** (default, legacy) — unchanged: `TDEE = RMR × activity_multiplier`, `goal = TDEE + deficit`.
- **dynamic** — `goal = RMR × base_multiplier + credited active kcal + deficit`, where `credited = round(active_kcal × activity_credit_pct/100)`. Base multiplier is deliberately near-sedentary (default 1.20) so exercise added on top doesn't double-count. Credit % (default 50) is the "don't eat back 100% of exercise" knob, clinician-set.

Active calories per day come from (priority order): **(1) wearable** `wearable_daily_metrics.active_kcal`, else **(2) MET estimate** from the sessions scheduled for that weekday in the patient's active program — `kcal = MET × bodyweight(kg) × est_minutes/60`, MET per session kind (strength 5.0 / zone2 6.5 / vo2max 8.5 / mobility 2.8), overridable via new `session_library.met`.

Files: **migration `0020_activity_aware_calories.sql`** (diet_plans.activity_mode/base_multiplier/activity_credit_pct + checks; wearable_daily_metrics.active_kcal/total_kcal; session_library.met), `lib/activity-calories.ts` (new), `lib/diet.ts` (deriveTargets + DietTargets/DietPlanRow + getMyDietTargets now compute the day's activity), wearable fetchers (`types.ts` DailyMetric, `sync.ts` upsert, `oura.ts` daily_activity active_calories/total_calories, `whoop.ts` kilojoule→total_kcal only — Whoop has no active-only figure so those days fall back to MET), clinician editor (`diet/actions.ts` schema+SQL, `diet/diet-plan-card.tsx` mode toggle + base + credit slider, `patient/[id]/page.tsx` initial mapping ×2), patient `home/diet/page.tsx` goal card breakdown + source badge, `db/schema.ts`.

**Typecheck:** clean on the real `src/` copy (the stale nested `grand-health-app/grand-health-app/` duplicates still throw pre-existing errors but are gitignored and not deployed — yet another reason to move the repo out of iCloud).

**⏳ TO SHIP:**
1. **Run migration on staging** (idempotent): `psql "$DIRECT_DATABASE_URL" -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -f supabase/migrations/0020_activity_aware_calories.sql` (tunnel + `DIRECT_DATABASE_URL` as for 0019).
2. `git add -A && git commit -m "Activity-aware calorie targets (wearable + MET, clinician credit %)" && git push`.
3. Test: clinician → a patient's Diet plan card → switch to **Dynamic**, set base 1.20 + credit 50% → save. As that patient, Diet screen goal shows `Base N + M from activity`. With a logged/scheduled workout (or a wearable active_kcal row), the goal rises; badge shows "estimated" or "<provider> synced".

## Original plan / context (Staging deploy migration)

**Goal:** get the app live on a shared URL for internal testing, HIPAA-compliant, AWS + GitHub.

**Why not Amplify (the original plan):** AWS Amplify Hosting (a) can't run inside a VPC so it can't reach our private RDS, and (b) is **not HIPAA-eligible** (can't serve PHI even with a BAA). App Runner was the next pick but it's **closed to new customers as of 2026-04-30**. **Decision: host on AWS ECS Fargate** (HIPAA-eligible, runs in our VPC, reaches private RDS), image built/pushed by **GitHub Actions**.

**Done & pushed to `main`:**
- Production build fixes — 17 TS errors resolved (incl. two real `row is not defined` bugs in diet/grand100 save actions); `eslint.ignoreDuringBuilds` set (no eslint config exists). Build/typecheck is clean.
- Removed the stray nested `grand-health-app/` embedded git repo; it's now gitignored.
- `Dockerfile` + `.dockerignore` + `output: "standalone"` in next.config (container build; runs `next start`).
- `apprunner.yaml` — vestigial (App Runner abandoned); harmless, can delete later.
- `infra/lib/app-runtime.ts` — **ECS Fargate CDK**: ECR repo, GitHub OIDC deploy role, app-env Secrets Manager secret, and (phase 2) ECS cluster + Fargate service + ALB. Wired into `grand-health-stack.ts` behind `-c withService=true`. Both phases `cdk synth` clean.

**NEXT STEPS (resume here): full ordered runbook in `docs/deploy-staging-runbook.md`.**

Target: **https://staging.mygrandhealth.com** (custom domain + TLS, Route 53 zone in this account). Done since last update:
- **GitHub Actions workflow written** — `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`. OIDC → deploy role; builds image, pushes `:<sha>`+`:latest` to ECR, registers task def + rolls the ECS service on push to `main`. Phase-1-aware: if the service doesn't exist yet it builds/pushes and skips the service update.
- **Domain + TLS wired into CDK** — `app-runtime.ts` now takes `domainName`/`hostedZoneName` (via `-c domain=... -c hostedZone=...`): looks up the Route 53 zone, mints a DNS-validated ACM cert, serves HTTPS with HTTP→HTTPS redirect, and creates the alias record. `siteUrl` defaults to `https://<domain>`.
- **Cognito callback/logout URLs** updated to `https://staging.mygrandhealth.com/...` (+ localhost) in `grand-health-stack.ts`.

Sequence (details/gotchas in the runbook): (1) commit infra+workflow; (2) Phase-1 `cdk deploy -c stage=staging` → record `AppRuntimeGithubDeployRoleArn`; (3) GitHub config: secret `AWS_DEPLOY_ROLE_ARN`, variable `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://staging.mygrandhealth.com`; (4) `git push` builds first image; (5) Phase-2 `cdk deploy -c stage=staging -c withService=true -c domain=staging.mygrandhealth.com -c hostedZone=mygrandhealth.com`; (6) fill `grand-health/staging/app-env` secret + `aws ecs update-service --force-new-deployment`; (7) create test users + run `docs/staging-smoke-test.md`.

**Key facts:** account `669960694177`, region `us-east-1`, Cognito pool `us-east-1_Yk5gVyw4D`, client `n9pkk4kb0doa5hhspsv510ecq`, seed clinic `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001`. RDS `dbSg` already admits the whole VPC CIDR on 5432, so Fargate tasks reach it with no extra SG rule. **Caution:** repo lives in an iCloud-synced folder — causes git `index.lock` / sync-conflict issues; consider moving to `~/dev/`.

## Stack

| Layer | Choice |
|---|---|
| Framework | Next.js 14 (App Router, TypeScript) |
| Hosting | AWS Amplify Hosting |
| Auth | AWS Cognito (via `aws-amplify` v6) |
| Database | AWS RDS Postgres 16 |
| Realtime (chat) | Server-Sent Events (`/api/messages/stream`) |
| ORM | Drizzle + postgres-js (raw SQL via `withAuth`) |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS |
| Forms validation | Zod |
| Infrastructure | AWS CDK v2 (`infra/` directory) |

**Supabase has been fully removed.** `@supabase/ssr` and `@supabase/supabase-js` are not
in `package.json` and have no live imports. The compatibility shim (`src/lib/supabase/server.ts`,
`src/lib/db/query-builder.ts`) and dead browser client (`src/lib/supabase/client.ts`) are
tombstone stubs — do not import from them. All queries now use `withAuth` + `serviceRoleSql`
from `@/lib/db/connection` directly.

**HIPAA coverage:** All data lives in AWS services covered by the AWS BAA. No
third-party HIPAA add-on fees.

PHI scoping is enforced by Postgres Row Level Security. Every table that
holds patient data carries `clinic_id` (and where applicable `patient_id`)
so policies can filter on a single column.

There is also a separate single-file prototype at
`../grandhealth-prototype.jsx` that we are migrating *from*. It still
contains features that haven't been ported yet — when stuck on visual or
behavioural intent, look there.

## Schema overview

Patient-bearing tables that hold PHI all carry `clinic_id` and (where applicable) `patient_id`.

**Identity + chrome**
- `clinics`
- `profiles` (1:1 with `auth.users`)
- `patient_profiles` (extends profile)
- `clinician_profiles` (extends profile)

**Pillars**
- `pillars` (per patient, has `hidden` flag)
- `pillar_factors` (risks with current/goal/status/weight/source/note, hidden flag, sort_order)
- `factor_observations` (time-series of factor values; built but no UI yet)
- `lifestyle_drivers`
- `pillar_recommendations`
- `risk_factor_library` + `risk_factor_sets` + `risk_factor_set_items` (clinic-wide)

**Training**
- `exercise_library` (kind: strength|mobility, video metadata)
- `session_library` (kind: strength|zone2|vo2max|mobility; cardio fields nullable per kind)
- `session_exercises` + `session_sets` (strength + mobility sessions)
- `program_library` + `program_days` (Mon-Sun grid)
- `program_assignments` (per patient)
- `hr_zones` (Z1-Z5 per clinic) + `training_targets` (one row per clinic)

**Diet**
- `diet_plans` (1 per patient: RMR, multiplier, deficit, macros, fiber, water, notes)
- `food_logs` (1 per patient per day; daily totals)
- `food_log_entries` (per-meal entries referencing foods)
- `foods` (USDA-cached + clinic custom; per-100g nutrient values incl. micros; `barcode` column for GTIN/UPC re-resolution)
- `food_favorites` (per-patient saved foods with optional remembered default quantity + meal)
- Trigger `recompute_food_log_totals()` keeps `food_logs` totals in sync with entries.

**Stack (meds & supplements)**
- `medications` — clinician-managed list per patient. Kind = 'medication' | 'supplement'. Optional `pillar_id` for "this addresses ApoB" type links. Refill columns added in 0017: `quantity_on_hand`, `quantity_per_dose`, `refill_threshold_days`, `last_refill_on`.
- `medication_doses` — schedule rows. One med may have many. `time_local` (no tz, patient's clock), `days_of_week` smallint[] mask (0=Sun..6=Sat) for daily / weekly / weekends-only / weekly-Sunday-rapamycin.
- `medication_dose_logs` — per-(dose, scheduled_for) check-off. UNIQUE(dose_id, scheduled_for) so toggling is insert/delete. Patient or clinician can record; `recorded_role` tracks which.
- `medication_interactions` — clinic-scoped library of pairwise rules. Two name patterns (case-insensitive substring) + severity (info/warn/severe) + message. Active flag for soft-disable.
- `medication_change_log` — per-medication history timeline. Trigger-populated on insert/update/delete of `medications`; runs SECURITY DEFINER so writes succeed despite RLS. Captures `change_type` (create/update/delete/refill — refill is detected by an upward bump of `quantity_on_hand`), `changed_fields` text[], plus full `before` + `after` jsonb snapshots. Read policy mirrors the main stack (patient self or clinic clinician); no write policies — only the trigger inserts.
- RLS: clinician-only writes on `medications` + `medication_doses` + `medication_interactions`. Patient writes own `medication_dose_logs`; clinician can also log on patient's behalf. `medication_change_log` is read-only from the app.

**Grand 100**
- `grand100_activities` (clinic-wide library of "what to do at 100" with required VO2/strength/mobility)
- `grand100_baselines` (per patient: VO2 now, grip, etc.)

**Messaging**
- `messages` (one implicit thread per `patient_id`; each row has `sender_id`, `sender_role`, `recipient_id`, `body`, `recipient_read_at`).
- Realtime publication `supabase_realtime` is set on this table so the chat UIs append new rows live.
- Patient → clinician messages address a specific clinician; clinician → patient messages set `recipient_id = patient_id`. All clinicians in the clinic see every thread but unread state is per-recipient.

**Wearables**
- `wearable_connections` — one row per (patient, provider). Holds access/refresh tokens + provider_user_id. NO INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE RLS policies → all writes go through the service-role key from server route handlers.
- `wearable_connections_public` — VIEW exposing everything except the token columns. Patient + clinician apps read this; the underlying table's SELECT policy still scopes by patient_id / clinic.
- `wearable_daily_metrics` — one row per (patient, provider, day). Normalized fields: sleep_total_minutes, sleep_efficiency_pct, hrv_rmssd_ms, recovery_score, readiness_score, etc. Full payload in `raw` jsonb.
- `wearable_webhook_events` — insert-only log for replay/debug. Service-role-only.
- Providers: `oura` and `whoop` are wired natively. `apple_health` requires the Capacitor iOS shell (deferred). `eight_sleep` has no public OAuth API (deferred).

**Compliance**
- `audit_log` — every PHI mutation writes a row.

---

## RLS patterns

All policies live in the migration files. Two helper functions, defined in `0002_rls_policies.sql`:

- `public.current_user_role()` → 'clinician' | 'patient' | null
- `public.current_user_clinic()` → uuid of the user's clinic

The recurring patterns:

**Patient sees own / clinician sees their clinic.**

```sql
using (
  patient_id = auth.uid()
  or (public.current_user_role() = 'clinician' and clinic_id = public.current_user_clinic())
)
```

**Clinician-only writes in clinic.**

```sql
using (
  public.current_user_role() = 'clinician'
  and clinic_id = public.current_user_clinic()
)
```

**Patient reads training library content scoped through assignment.** See `0005_patient_training_reads.sql` — the EXISTS joins through `program_assignments` → `program_days` → session/exercise. Reference these when adding patient-facing reads on other clinic-wide tables. Important: fully qualify column names like `public.session_library.id` inside subqueries because outer/inner tables often share names like `id`.

---

## Conventions

**Server actions live next to the route they serve.** E.g. patient diet edits in `src/app/home/diet/entry-actions.ts`, clinician pillar edits in `src/app/clinician/patient/[id]/pillar/[pillarId]/actions.ts`. This keeps refactors local and import paths short.

**Every mutation calls `recordAudit()` from `@/lib/audit`.** Audit row captures `actor_id`, `actor_role`, `clinic_id`, `entity_type`, `entity_id`, `patient_id`, plus a JSONB `meta` blob (typically `{ before, after }`).

**`revalidatePath()` after every server-side mutation** so the new state shows up on the next render. Most actions revalidate the page they were called from plus any pages that read the same data (e.g. patient `/home/diet` AND `/home` after a food log change).

**Zod schemas at the top of every action file** validate inputs before the DB call. Reject early.

**All queries use `withAuth` or `serviceRoleSql` directly** — no ORM, no shim. Pattern:
```typescript
import { requireUser } from "@/lib/auth/server";       // or requireClinician / requirePatient
import { withAuth, serviceRoleSql } from "@/lib/db/connection";

const user = await requireUser();
const rows = await withAuth(user, (sql) =>
  sql`SELECT id, name FROM table WHERE patient_id = ${user.id}`
);
```
Use `serviceRoleSql` for cron jobs, webhook handlers, and audit writes (bypasses RLS). Use `withAuth` for all user-scoped queries (sets `app.current_user_id/role/clinic_id` session vars that RLS policies read).

Drizzle is wired up (`src/lib/db/index.ts`) but not used for queries — it's there for future typed schema work. The SQL migrations in `supabase/migrations/` are the source of truth for the schema.

**Tailwind: no dynamic class names.** The JIT compiler can't see `bg-${color}-500` style strings. Use literal classes everywhere.

**Numeric columns in Postgres come back as strings through postgres-js.** Use `Number(r.col)` to convert. Don't rely on automatic coercion.

---

## Auth + role gating

- Login at `/login` — password sign-in via Cognito. Magic-link removed (was Supabase-only).
- Auth layer: `src/lib/auth/server.ts` — `getUser()` / `requireUser()` / `requireClinician()` / `requirePatient()`. Reads Cognito JWT from `gh_id_token` cookie (set at `/auth/callback`).
- `src/lib/auth/middleware.ts` — verifies JWT via JWKS on every request, redirects unauthenticated users to `/login`, sends logged-in users to role-appropriate home.
- Patient layouts (`/home/*`) call `requirePatient()`. Clinician layouts call `requireClinician()`.

---

## Where each migration lives

Run them in numeric order in the Supabase SQL Editor when bootstrapping a fresh project. They're additive and idempotent (where applicable they use `drop policy if exists` / `add column if not exists`).

Then `supabase/seed.sql` for synthetic data (replace the two placeholder UUIDs with real `auth.users.id` values you've invited).

---

## Git / GitHub

Repo: `https://github.com/tdennis-blip/grand-health-app`

Day-to-day workflow — before switching machines:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "what you did"
git push
```
When sitting down at another machine: `git pull`.

---

## Tombstone files (do not import from these)

These files exist only to preserve git history — they export nothing:
- `src/lib/supabase/server.ts` — was the SupabaseCompat shim
- `src/lib/db/query-builder.ts` — was the SupabaseCompat + SupaQuery classes
- `src/lib/supabase/client.ts` — was the browser Supabase client
- `src/lib/supabase/middleware.ts` — was the Supabase session middleware
- `src/lib/wearables/admin-client.ts` — was the service-role Supabase client

---

## Local setup quick ref

```bash
cd grand-health-app
cp .env.example .env.local      # fill Supabase URL + publishable key + connection strings + USDA key
npm install
npm run dev
```

For password-based dev sign-ins (avoiding email rate limits):

```sql
update auth.users
set encrypted_password = crypt('YourDevPassword123', gen_salt('bf'))
where email = 'you@example.com';
```

For wearable testing locally: tunnel your dev server so the OAuth callback (and webhooks) can reach you. `ngrok http 3000` or `cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:3000`. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` to the public URL and add it as the OAuth redirect in the Oura/Whoop developer consoles. The daily backfill cron can be exercised with `curl -X POST localhost:3000/api/wearables/sync -H "x-cron-token: $WEARABLES_CRON_TOKEN"`.

The refill-check cron is the same pattern: `curl -X POST localhost:3000/api/medications/refill-check -H "x-cron-token: $MEDICATIONS_CRON_TOKEN"`. Findings are written to `audit_log` (entity_type='medication_refill_alert') and de-duped within a calendar day.

---

## Deployment

### First-time AWS setup (one-time)
1. Create AWS account at aws.amazon.com
2. Sign BAA: AWS Console → AWS Artifact → Agreements → AWS Business Associate Addendum
3. Install AWS CLI + CDK: `npm install -g aws-cdk` then `aws configure`
4. Deploy infrastructure: `cd infra && npm install && cdk bootstrap && cdk deploy -c stage=staging`
5. Copy the CDK outputs (UserPoolId, UserPoolClientId, RDS endpoint) into `.env.local`
6. Run all 18 migrations in order against RDS
7. Seed data: update `supabase/seed.sql` to use real Cognito user IDs, run it

### Amplify Hosting
`amplify.yml` is already configured. Connect the repo in the Amplify console, set app root to `grand-health-app`, add env vars from `.env.local`, deploy.

Required env vars in Amplify console:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_AWS_REGION`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_COGNITO_CLIENT_ID`
- `DATABASE_URL`
- `SERVICE_ROLE_DATABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`
- `USDA_API_KEY`
- Wearable OAuth keys
- Cloudinary keys
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`

### Creating users (no self-signup)
Users are created by an admin in the Cognito console or via AWS CLI:
```bash
aws cognito-idp admin-create-user \
  --user-pool-id <USER_POOL_ID> \
  --username patient@example.com \
  --user-attributes Name=email,Value=patient@example.com \
                    Name=custom:role,Value=patient \
                    Name=custom:clinic_id,Value=<CLINIC_UUID> \
  --temporary-password TempPass123
```
Then in the app they sign in and are prompted to set a permanent password.

Their Cognito `sub` (UUID) must match the `profiles.id` row in the database.
Insert the profile row after creating the Cognito user:
```sql
INSERT INTO profiles (id, clinic_id, role, email, first_name, last_name)
VALUES ('<cognito-sub>', '<clinic-uuid>', 'patient', 'patient@example.com', 'First', 'Last');
```

---

## State of migration from prototype

**Done.** Auth + role gating, patient roster, full pillar editor (risks/drivers/recs/note), risk-factor library + sets + save-as-set, training library (exercises with kinds, sessions with kinds, programs with Mon-Sun grid + assignment, zones + targets), patient-facing training views (Today card, week, session detail), mobile chrome with 5-tab bar, patient pillar list + detail, pillar visibility toggles, diet plan editor, food logging (USDA search + per-meal entries + auto-aggregate + micronutrients), favorites + recent-foods quick-add strip, custom-food creation (clinic-scoped, immediate add), barcode scanning (Capacitor MLKit on native, Web BarcodeDetector on supported browsers, manual entry fallback) with local-cache → USDA gtinUpc resolution and graceful 404 → custom-food handoff, 7-day adherence chart, Grand 100 (activities + baseline + trajectory chart + back-cast), clinician-side Grand 100 activity library editor (CRUD + hide + reorder), patient profile editor (name / DOB / sex / height / weight with cm-kg ↔ ft-lb toggle, RLS-locked clinic + clinician), patient ↔ clinic messaging (per-patient threads with addressed recipients, Realtime, unread badges on patient bottom-tab + clinician top nav + inbox per row), clinician audit log viewer at `/clinician/audit` (URL-driven filters for date range / action / entity_type / actor / patient / free-text, expandable rows with meta JSON drilldown, offset pagination), wearables integration for Oura + Whoop (OAuth start/callback, webhook receivers w/ HMAC verification, daily cron backfill, patient Today sleep+recovery card, clinician 30-day trend card, integrations settings page), stack (meds & supplements: clinician-managed, per-dose-per-day check-offs, today grouped by morning/midday/evening/night, 7-day adherence strip, optional pillar linkage shown in pillar Recommendations tab, summary card + full editor on clinician patient page), stack extensions (clinic-wide drug interaction rules library at `/clinician/library/interactions`, refill tracking with per-med qty-on-hand + qty-per-dose + threshold + last-refill-on + quick "+ Refill" action + low/out badges surfaced to patient and clinician, per-med adherence report at `/clinician/patient/[id]/stack/adherence` with selectable 7/14/30/90d window + per-day heatmap + longest miss streak + CSV export at `/api/medications/adherence.csv`, per-medication change history timeline at `/clinician/patient/[id]/stack/history` populated by a SECURITY DEFINER trigger on `medications` with per-med drill-down at `.../history/[medicationId]`, clinic-wide refill queue at `/clinician/refills` plus daily cron at `/api/medications/refill-check` writing alerts into `audit_log`, patient-side "Request refill" button on `/home/stack` that posts a message to the primary clinician).

**Not yet built.**
- Apple Health integration (needs Capacitor iOS shell — only HealthKit gives you read access, no web OAuth exists)
- Eight Sleep integration (no public OAuth API — placeholder tile in integrations page)
- Clinician-entered food logs on behalf of patient (schema supports it)
- Per-factor genetic flag gating (e.g. ApoE4) — replaceable by individual factor hide for now

**Capacitor shell.** `capacitor.config.ts` is committed but the iOS/Android
projects are not (they're generated from the config). To stand them up on
your dev machine:

```bash
cd grand-health-app
npm install --include=optional        # pulls @capacitor/* + @capacitor-mlkit/barcode-scanning
CAPACITOR_SERVER_URL=https://<your-tunnel> npm run cap:init  # one-time: adds ios/ + android/
npm run cap:sync
npm run cap:ios       # opens Xcode
```

The shell loads from `CAPACITOR_SERVER_URL` (or `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` in
prod) — there is no separate bundled web build. `BarcodeScanner` in
`src/app/home/diet/barcode-scanner.tsx` feature-detects
`window.Capacitor.isNativePlatform()` and dynamic-imports
`@capacitor-mlkit/barcode-scanning` only on native, so the web build stays
unaffected.

## Patterns to copy when adding new features

When adding a new patient-side view that reads PHI:

1. Server component calls `requirePatient()` to get `user`, then fetches with `withAuth(user, sql => sql\`...\`)`. RLS handles scoping.
2. Pull related data in parallel with `Promise.all([...])`.
3. Pass shaped data into a small client component for any interactivity.
4. Add a route + tab if it needs navigation.

When adding a new clinician-side editor:

1. Create `actions.ts` in the route folder with `"use server"`. Define Zod schemas. Each action: validate → upsert → audit → revalidate.
2. Server component renders the data + a client form component.
3. Client component holds form state with `useState`, calls actions via `useTransition`, shows "Saving…" + "Saved." states.

When adding a new SQL migration:

1. Number it `00XX_short_name.sql`.
2. Make it idempotent: `create table if not exists`, `add column if not exists`, `drop policy if exists` before each `create policy`.
3. Update `src/lib/db/schema.ts` to match.
4. Reference patterns from the closest existing migration.

---

## When stuck

- For unclear visual / behavioural intent → look at `../grandhealth-prototype.jsx`. It's one giant JSX file but every feature lives there.
- For unclear data shapes → look at the relevant migration file in `supabase/migrations/`.
- For unclear auth patterns → look at `src/lib/auth/server.ts`, `src/lib/db/connection.ts`, and `0002_rls_policies.sql`.
- For unclear query patterns → look at any recent actions file, e.g. `src/app/home/diet/entry-actions.ts`.
- For unclear deployment → `README.md` + `amplify.yml`.
